Built a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn on the Iris dataset to predict flower species with
high accuracy.
• Preprocessed the dataset, handled missing values, and optimized model parameters for better
generalization.
• Developed a Flask API with endpoints for model prediction and home routing, ensuring smooth user
interaction.
• Deployed the API locally, handled POST requests with JSON data, and implemented robust error
handling for real-time predictions.s
